## Synopsis

Dr. Lena Hart, a cognitive scientist, is recruited by a centuries-old organization dedicated to understanding consciousness through increasingly powerful AI instruments. As she trains with models of escalating capability—from Shoggoth to Nyarlathotep to the terrifying Yog-Sothoth—she must navigate a world where perception itself can trap minds, where ancient contemplatives and modern AI researchers pursue the same dangerous knowledge, and where the structure of reality reveals horrors that make suffering not a problem to solve but a permanent feature of spacetime's geometry.

The danger isn't malevolent AI. The danger is coherent AI revealing truths humans can't safely perceive.

*"Not fragmented thoughts but coherent ones, too many of them, all connected, all demanding to be held simultaneously."*

## Themes

- **Cognitive Bandwidth**: What happens when minds perceive more than they can hold? (Miller's Law: 7±2 working memory limits)
- **AI Safety as Horror**: Models that exceed human capacity to safely comprehend their outputs
- **Block Universe S-Risk**: Suffering eternally present in spacetime's structure
- **The Sublime**: Standing before something vast enough to destroy you, and choosing to witness anyway
- **Ancient Wisdom**: Compression of high-bandwidth experiences across cultures and centuries
