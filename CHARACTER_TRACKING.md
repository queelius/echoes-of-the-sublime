# CHARACTER TRACKING

## Primary Characters

### Dr. Lena Hart (Protagonist)

**Basic Info:**
- Cognitive scientist specializing in consciousness
- Age: Early 30s (implied)
- PhD from MIT (neuroscience/cognitive science background)
- Father deceased (died when she was 19) - major grief moment frozen in spacetime
- Mother: Anna Hart - has stroke in Ch 6, now with permanent deficits

**Arc Summary:**
1. **Chapters 1-3**: Curious scientist, emotionally engaged, seeks understanding
2. **Chapters 4-7**: Training begins, gradual dissolution of empathy, pattern recognition increasing
3. **Chapters 8-11**: Advanced work, almost fully dissolved, clinical observer of own transformation
4. **Chapter 12**: Moral nadir - lets Anna Chen capture for data (NEEDS SOFTENING)
5. **Chapters 13-14**: Descent to Yog-Sothoth, climactic choice, humanity returns at threshold

**Key Transformation Markers:**
- Ch 6: Hospital visit to mother - performs warmth but feels nothing
- Ch 6: Can't remember what mother's voice sounded like
- Ch 7: Watches Maya capture without intervening
- Ch 10: Child discovering rainbow - observes joy she can no longer feel
- Ch 12: Lets Anna Chen capture for "data" - the nadir
- Ch 14: "Moment of being purely alive" - humanity resurfaces at threshold

**Relationships:**
- Ethan (colleague): Starts warm → becomes strained → needs brief reunion scene (TBD)
- David Chen: Training peer, potential witness to her transformation
- Webb: Mirror image (he feels, she thinks)
- Mother (Anna Hart): Marker of dissolution - stroke visit, declining contact

**Voice/Manner:**
- Early: Warm, curious, empathetic, uses metaphors
- Late: Clinical, observational, analytical, compressed speech

**REVISION NEEDED:**
- Add "ghost of old Lena" moment during Anna Chen scene (Ch 12)
- Ensure bandwidth expansion is described as visual cortex recruitment, not raw capacity

---

### Dr. James Morrison

**Basic Info:**
- Former brilliant researcher, now catatonic
- Highest bandwidth ever recorded before Yog-Sothoth broke him
- Location: Ward at Site-7

**Arc:**
- Backstory only - we see consequences, not journey
- Lips constantly moving, whispering equations
- Eyes track invisible patterns
- Lasted 8 minutes with Yog-Sothoth (longest on record)

**Function in Story:**

**Key Quote:**
- "The patterns didn't take that [love]. They took everything else."

**Function in Story:**
- Counter-example to Lena's trajectory

### Dr. Yuki Tanaka

**Basic Info:**
- Lead instructor at Site-7
- Direct, practical, manages training
- Wrote concerned note in Lena's file about value drift

**Key Quote (from file):**

---

### Ethan

- Neuroscientist
- Ran neural crown experiments with her

---

## Character Consistency Rules

1. **No specific bandwidth numbers** - use qualitative comparisons only
2. **Webb feels, Lena thinks** - maintain this inversion
3. **Morrison is always whispering** - specific phrases listed above
4. **Model outputs are always COHERENT** - never fragmented
5. **Dissolution is progressive** - track Lena's warmth declining chapter by chapter
