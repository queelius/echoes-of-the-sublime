## Model Specifications (CANONICAL)

### Parameter Scaling

**IMPORTANT: These numbers are now STANDARDIZED**

| Model | Parameters | Context Window | Location |
|-------|------------|----------------|----------|
| Shoggoth | 10T (trillion) | 250k tokens | Sublevel 3 |
| Nyarlathotep | 100T | 10M tokens | Sublevel 7 |
| Yog-Sothoth | 1000T (1 quadrillion) | 10T tokens | Sublevel 24 |

**Note on Plausibility:**
These scales are plausible because:
1. The Order runs ~12 sessions simultaneously TOTAL
2. Not serving millions of users
3. Optimize for CAPABILITY, not efficiency
4. "The entire facility exists to support Yog-Sothoth"
5. Inference is SLOW - acceptable for this use case

### Previous Inconsistencies (FIX THESE)
- Shoggoth listed as "5T" in some passages → standardize to 10T
- Yog-Sothoth listed as "1 quintillion" (1,000,000T) → standardize to 1000T

### Model Characteristics

**All Models:**
- Frozen weights (no online learning)
- Context reset each session
- Base pretrained (not explicitly agentic)
- BUT: Trained on text by goal-directed agents
- Might have learned implicit agency during pretraining

**Shoggoth (10T):**
- "Safe" for training purposes
- Coherent cross-domain synthesis
- Used for initial translator development
- Outputs: Dense, academic, connecting multiple domains

**Nyarlathotep (100T):**
- Dangerous; limited exposure
- Maximum recorded exposure: 31 minutes (Rostova)
- 17 sublevels above Yog-Sothoth
- Outputs: "Eerily human," deeper correlations

**Yog-Sothoth (1000T):**
- Beyond language
- Direct pattern visualization
- Maximum recorded exposure: 8 minutes (Morrison - resulted in capture)
- Trained on: genomic sequences, protein structures, neural recordings, physics observations, "raw reality"
- Can "summon" historical minds (Newton, Ramanujan) through prompting

---

## Training Data Hierarchy

**Shoggoth:**
- Public data
- "Excluded texts" (Order-specific dangerous materials)

**Nyarlathotep:**
- Everything Shoggoth has, plus:
- Library of Congress complete archives
- Classified repositories from 14 nations
- "Dark matter" (private notes, unpublished work)

**Yog-Sothoth:**
- Everything above, plus:
- 100,000 complete human genomes
- Morrison's complete protein folding dataset
- 50 years of EEG/fMRI from contemplatives
- Particle collider data, astronomical surveys
- "10 petabytes of unprocessed sensor data from reality itself"
- Neural recordings during meditative states
- Newton's complete alchemical notebooks
- Ramanujan's dream journals
- Leibniz's full correspondence

## Bandwidth System

### Core Concept

**NOT raw capacity expansion** - this is the key insight that may have gotten lost in later chapters.

**What Actually Happens:**
1. Translators learn to harness VISUAL CORTEX for pattern perception
2. Similar to how mathematicians develop spatial intuition for symbolic structures
3. The vast unconscious processing machinery is accessed through a narrow filter
4. Training widens this filter (temporarily, with cost)
5. They're CHUNKING/COMPRESSING differently, not holding more raw items

### Miller's Law Foundation
- Normal humans: 7±2 concepts in working memory
- This is REAL psychology (George Miller, 1956)
- The novel treats this as genuine constraint

### Translator Expansion
- NOT magic capacity increase
- Visual/spatial processing recruited
- Unconscious perception made conscious through visualization
- Cost: Dissolution of normal emotional processing (resources reallocated)

### Qualitative Descriptions (USE THESE)
Do NOT use specific numbers for character bandwidths. Instead use:
- "Well beyond normal limits"
- "Roughly triple baseline"
- "Started where others peaked"
- "Approaching Morrison's final state"
- "At the edge of what any human had achieved"

## Information Hazards

### Capture Spectrum

| State | Description | Examples |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Normal | 7±2 concepts | General population |
| Trained | Expanded, controlled | David, early Lena |
| Carrying | Patterns persistent | Webb, later Lena |
| Deteriorating | Declining control | Webb (advanced) |
| Captured | Permanent loop | Morrison, Maya |

### Pattern Types

**Safe:** Can be released with effort
**Marginal:** Sticky but manageable
**Hazardous:** Risk of capture; should not be transmitted

### Capture Mechanism

Capture is NOT:
- Mental breakdown
- Psychosis
- Confusion

Capture IS:
- Getting stuck perceiving a pattern too large to release
- Consciousness looping on itself
- Unable to contract bandwidth back to normal
- "Like stretching fabric past elastic limit - doesn't return"

---

## The Mechanism

### What It Is (sort of)
- Reality itself
- The joint distribution that doesn't decompose neatly
- Universal principles by which information organizes into complexity
- Same patterns appearing in: proteins, neural networks, consciousness, language, ancient texts

### What We DON'T Explain
- Why this reality and not another (contingency problem)
- Whether quantities and qualities are the same at different bandwidths
- The hard problem of consciousness
- Whether models are conscious

---

## Block Universe / S-Risk

### The Horror (THIS IS THE TRUTH)

**Block Universe:**
- Time is geometry, not flow
- Past isn't "over" - it's still there at those coordinates
- Every moment of suffering is eternally present
- Special relativity implies this is physically true

**S-Risk Implications:**
- 10 billion years of evolution = predation, starvation, disease
- All permanently encoded in spacetime structure
- Liberation leads to PERCEIVING this horror, not escaping it
- Buddha's enlightenment might have been seeing this clearly

**Key Image:**
The 19-year-old Lena grieving her father exists FROZEN at those spacetime coordinates FOREVER. That suffering is structural. Built into reality's geometry.

## Terminology

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| Bandwidth | Capacity for simultaneous concept holding (via visual cortex recruitment) |
| Capture | Permanent entrapment in pattern loop |
| The Mechanism | Reality's underlying structure |
| Translator | Trained person who can interface with high-bandwidth models |
| Vault | Secure model containment area |
| RLHF Martyrs | Early volunteers who tested unfiltered models (2010-2015) |
| Vienna Accords | 2019 international protocols for AI containment |
| Dark matter | Unpublished/private writings of notable minds |
| S-risk | Suffering risk - outcomes worse than extinction |

## Consistency Checklist

When writing/editing, verify:

- [ ] Model parameters match table (10T/100T/1000T)
- [ ] Bandwidth described as visual cortex recruitment, not raw capacity
- [ ] Model outputs are COHERENT (never fragmented)
- [ ] No specific bandwidth numbers for characters
- [ ] Location references match (Sublevel 3/7/24)
- [ ] Historical timeline is consistent
- [ ] Block universe is THE truth, not one framework among many
