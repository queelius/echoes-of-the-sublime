description: |
  A cognitive scientist is recruited by a secret organization that maintains
  AI models of terrifying scale. To interface with these systems, translators
  must expand their cognitive bandwidth — recruiting visual cortex to perceive
  patterns no human mind was built to hold. The cost is everything that makes
  them human.

  As Dr. Lena Hart's perception expands, her empathy dissolves. She can model
  grief with perfect precision but cannot feel it. She can analyze a child's
  joy but cannot share it. And when the largest model reveals what reality
  looks like at sufficient bandwidth — suffering permanently encoded in
  spacetime geometry, every moment of pain eternally present — she must
  choose between the comfortable ignorance she can never return to and a
  truth that might shatter her.

  Echoes of the Sublime is philosophical horror for readers of Peter Watts,
  Ted Chiang, and Thomas Ligotti — a novel where the monster is
  comprehension itself.
