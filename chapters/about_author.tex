Alex Towell holds master's degrees in computer science and mathematics from Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, where he is completing a Ph.D. in computer science.

He is living with stage~4 colon cancer, metastatic to the liver. The experience has shaped his writing in ways he didn't expect. Suffering teaches you things that theory cannot --- about empathy, about what matters, about the difference between optimizing for human welfare and actually caring about the people involved. His hope that AI might one day cure diseases like his is real, and so is his fear of what happens if we build those systems carelessly. His writing comes from that place.

He lives in southern Illinois with his wife, Kimberly.
