Alexander Towell is a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, where his research explores oblivious algorithms and encrypted search---systems designed to operate on data they cannot see. He holds master's degrees in both Computer Science and Mathematics, and has spent years thinking about the boundaries of what systems can and cannot know about themselves and their inputs.

\textit{Echoes of the Sublime} grew from the collision of two obsessions: the bandwidth limitations of human consciousness and the question of what happens when you try to exceed them. His research in oblivious computation---where systems must produce correct results without accessing their own data---offered an unexpected parallel to the novel's central concern: the architecture of awareness itself, and what breaks when you try to widen the aperture.

A cancer survivor and distance runner, Alex lives in southern Illinois with his wife, Kimberly. He suspects that consciousness is more compressed than we're comfortable admitting, but tries not to think about it during long runs.
