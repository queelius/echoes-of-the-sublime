Human working memory holds roughly seven items at once. George Miller documented this in 1956, and it remains one of the most robust findings in psychology. Everything we experience passes through this bottleneck. Consciousness is not a window onto reality. It is a compression algorithm.

\textit{Echoes of the Sublime} asks what happens when that compression is deliberately undone. The novel draws on Francisco Varela's neurophenomenology, Donald Hoffman's interface theory of perception, Buddhist Abhidharma philosophy, and the block universe interpretation of spacetime. The AI alignment concerns depicted reflect contemporary research on deceptive alignment, suffering risks, and information hazards.

The hard problem of consciousness is not resolved in these pages. It cannot be. That is the point.
